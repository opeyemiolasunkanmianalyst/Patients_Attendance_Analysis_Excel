# Hospital_Visits_Analysis
In this project, an exploratory data analysis with excel was done to derive key insights from a hospital dataset which contain the patients visits for different units of the hospital for the year 2022. Summary tables and a dashboard was presented to the stakeholders in addition to a written executive summary.

Executive Summary 
- The total hospital visits was 5194. Enrollee from Hygeia Hmo makes up more than 0ne-third of all visits with 44%. This is followed by patients from Axa Mansard Hmo and private patients at 23.63% and 23.58% respectively. Hence, private patients in addition to enrollees from Hygeia and Axa Mansard contributed to 91% of all visits in 2022. However, every other Hmo contributed less than 10% all visits in total.

- 70% of the patient was adult followed by school age children with 13.5%. Teenagers and under five children were below 10% each.

- The patient attendance increased progressively from first quarter to the last quarter with the last quarter having 340(23%) more patients than the first quarter. This was also the overall pattern for patient admission though there was a sligh dip in the third quarter. Hence the hospital ended the year with increase in both patient attendance and patient admission rate at 23% and 44% respectively.

- The unit with the highest patient load was the general outpatient(84%) followed by orthopaedics(12%). Other units contributed only less than 5% of total hospital visits.

- There was no significant difference in term of male to female ratio of 46% and 54% respectively.
